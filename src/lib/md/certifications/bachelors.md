## Overview

[University of Aveiro](https://www.ua.pt/) - [Certificate](TODO) - [Final Project](/projects/mepml)

My Bachelor's degree at University of Aveiro provided a comprehensive and robust foundation in core computer science principles and modern software development practices. The curriculum focused on developing strong problem-solving skills and an understanding of the entire software development lifecycle. I graduated with a final classification of 17/20.

**Key Areas of Study:**

*   **Object-Oriented Programming & Software Design:** Mastered OOP principles, design patterns, and well-established best practices for developing maintainable, scalable, and robust software applications.
*   **Software Development Methodologies:** Gained practical experience with Agile methodologies and implemented Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for efficient software delivery.
*   **Quality Assurance & Testing:** Developed a strong understanding of various testing strategies and quality assurance techniques to ensure software reliability and correctness.
*   **Full-Stack Development:** Acquired skills in both backend development (designing and implementing RESTful APIs) and frontend development, enabling the creation of complete web-based applications.
*   **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Built a solid theoretical and practical understanding of fundamental data structures and efficient algorithms, essential for optimizing computational solutions.
*   **Databases:** Studied relational and non-relational database concepts, including design, implementation, and query languages for effective data management.
*   **Security Fundamentals:** Explored core concepts of computer security, covering secure coding practices, network security, and data protection principles.

This program equipped me with essential technical skills and a holistic view of software engineering, laying a critical groundwork for my advanced studies and research.
