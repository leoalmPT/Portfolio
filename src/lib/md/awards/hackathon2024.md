## Overview

The Aveiro TechWeek is a prestigious annual event organized by the Município de Aveiro, bringing together the local tech community for a week of talks, workshops, and competitive events, celebrating innovation and fostering collaboration. A central highlight is its hackathon, where participants tackle real-world challenges proposed by leading local companies.

In 2024, my team participated in the hackathon, selecting the challenge posed by **Altice Labs: "MEDIA DIVE - New Interaction Forms on TV with Enriched Content."** This challenge sought novel ways to enhance user interaction with television content.

Our winning [solution](/projects/aitv) was an **innovative system designed to identify individual user profiles and create highly personalized TV experiences.** We moved beyond traditional show listings by generating dynamic, engaging summaries for content. This was achieved by leveraging enriched metadata from the MEDIA DIVE API and employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to create concise, transcript-based content overviews. The system dramatically improved content discoverability and user engagement, offering a futuristic approach to television interaction.

Our team's ability to rapidly prototype a complex, AI-driven solution that directly addressed a real-world industry need earned us **First Place** in the competition, along with a **5000€ prize**. This achievement showcased our skills in problem-solving, collaborative development, and applying cutting-edge AI technologies to create tangible impact.
