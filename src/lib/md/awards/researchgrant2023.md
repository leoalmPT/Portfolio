## Overview

[Details](/experience/researcher) - [2nd Year](/recognition/researchgrant2024)

This Research Grant marked the beginning of my two-year research journey, providing a foundational experience in a leading telecommunications research institute. It served as a crucial stepping stone into the world of academic research. 

Awarded by the **Instituto de Telecomunicações** (IT), this grant (BII N°2023/00066) enabled me delve into state-of-the-art research, familiarize myself with current challenges in network management and distributed systems, and develop core research skills. My work during this period directly informed and laid the groundwork for my subsequent Master's dissertation on Federated Learning.
