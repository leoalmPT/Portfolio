# Overview

The Think Twice Hackathon, organized by the IEEE Student Branch at the University of Aveiro, is a prominent competitive programming event that brings together students to tackle a diverse range of algorithmic challenges under time pressure. The 4th edition of this event in 2022 featured a series of problems designed to test participants' problem-solving skills, algorithmic knowledge, and coding efficiency.

**Challenge & Contribution:**

Our team competed in the **Algorithmic Category**, which involved solving a diverse set of 34 problems of increasing difficulty. These challenges spanned various domains of computer science, including:

*   **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Efficient manipulation of data and logic.
*   **Mathematics & Logic:** Problems requiring numerical reasoning, discrete mathematics, and logical deduction.
*   **Problem-Solving under Constraints:** Rapidly understanding complex problem statements and implementing correct, optimized solutions within given time and memory limits, using allowed languages like Java, Python3, and C/C++.

Our success in consistently developing correct and highly efficient solutions across these varied problems led us to secure the top position.

This achievement highlights my strong capabilities in competitive programming, complex algorithmic problem-solving, and effective teamwork under high-pressure conditions. It underscores my proficiency in designing and implementing optimized solutions for intricate computational tasks.
