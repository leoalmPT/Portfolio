## Overview

[Details](/experience/researcher) - [1st Year](/recognition/researchgrant2023)

This grant represents the second year of my continuous research experience, building upon the foundations established during my initial Research Grant at Instituto de Telecomunicações. This period was directly integrated into the Agenda Mobilizadora para a Inovação Empresarial "NEXUS - Pacto de Inovação – Transição Verde e Digital para Transportes, Logística e Mobilidade" project.

Awarded by the **University of Aveiro (UA)**, this grant (75/2024/BII/AgendasPRR) allowed me to deepen my expertise in applying cutting-edge AI and distributed computing in a practical, impact-driven context, furthering my contributions to both academic knowledge and industrial innovation.
