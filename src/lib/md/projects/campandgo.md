CampAndGo is a web application developed using **React**, designed to simulate the experience of searching for and reserving campsites. This project served as an initial exploration into React development and was a key learning tool for understanding user personas and conducting usability tests in a practical context.

## About the Project

The primary goal of CampAndGo was to provide a hands-on learning experience in modern web development, specifically with the React framework, and to apply concepts of user-centered design through persona creation and usability testing. The application simulates a full-fledged campsite booking platform, allowing users to interact with various features without a live backend. All data is **mocked**, providing a functional yet controlled environment for learning and demonstration.

**Key Features:**

*   **Campsite Search:** Users can search for campsites based on their preferences.
*   **Comprehensive Filtering:** Advanced filtering options allow users to narrow down search results by:
    *   **General Criteria:** Rating, Price, Environment, Location.
    *   **Amenities:** Presence of a pool, allowing animals, availability of bungalows, and dedicated campervan spaces.
*   **Favorites Management:** Users can add various types of accommodations to their favorites, including:
    *   Entire campsites.
    *   Individual tent sites.
    *   Campervan spaces.
    *   Bungalows.
*   **Reservation Simulation:** The platform allows users to select desired start and end dates to "reserve" their chosen spaces.
*   **Mock Payment Process:** A simulated payment flow is integrated to complete the reservation experience, demonstrating the full user journey without actual financial transactions.

**Learning Objectives:**

This project was specifically undertaken to:

*   Gain initial experience and familiarity with the **React library** for building dynamic user interfaces.
*   Understand and apply the methodology of creating **user personas** to guide design decisions.
*   Learn how to design and conduct **usability tests** to gather user feedback and iterate on the user experience.

## Final Thoughts

CampAndGo successfully achieved its educational objectives, providing valuable insights into frontend development with React, as well as the crucial role of user personas and usability testing in the software development lifecycle. While relying on mocked data, the project demonstrates a functional and intuitive user experience for campsite discovery and booking.
