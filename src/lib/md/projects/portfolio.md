## Overview

[Repository](https://github.com/leoalmPT/Portfolio) - [Website](https://leoalmpt.pages.dev/)

This project is my personal portfolio website, meticulously crafted from scratch using modern web technologies. Its primary goal is to present my diverse body of work—including projects, scientific research, professional experience, and recognition—in an interactive and highly searchable format. Built with Svelte, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with BitsUI/Shadcn components, the portfolio also integrates tsparticles for a dynamic visual experience.

## About the Project

The portfolio is designed to offer a dynamic and intuitive browsing experience for anyone interested in my professional journey. It goes beyond a static display to provide efficient access to detailed information.

**Content Organization:**
My accomplishments are categorized into distinct sections, each with a clear purpose:

*   **Projects:** "A collection of personal and collaborative software projects."
*   **Scientific Research:** "Published papers and academic contributions."
*   **Experience:** "Professional roles and internships where I applied and grew my skills."
*   **Recognition:** "Awards and certifications that acknowledge my skills and contributions."

**Powerful Search & Filtering:**
A core feature is its highly robust search functionality, designed for efficient discovery of content:

*   It implements a **fuzzy search** mechanism that intelligently matches queries even with typos or partial keywords.
*   Users can refine their searches using specific filters:
    *   **tech:** Filter by technology (e.g., Python, Docker, AWS, etc.) — supported by **autocomplete** for ease of use.
    *   **before:** Filter by date before (YYYY-MM-DD) — utilizing an interactive **calendar** for selection.
    *   **after:** Filter by date after (YYYY-MM-DD) — also with an interactive **calendar**.
